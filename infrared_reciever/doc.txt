#myremote.lircd.conf -> is a BN59-0937A remote for Samsung B52 inch LED TV, there is a one in the LIRC batabase, but it did not work
#so I created my own
cp myremote.lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd.conf.d
cp lircrc ~/.config #here are actions, that are triggered when you press a button on infrared RC

#in /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf : driver = default, device = /dev/lirc0
